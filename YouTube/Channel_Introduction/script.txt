Well hello and welcome to this, my new YouTube Channel.

Let me tell you a little about myself. I'm, Jason. I'm known as CloudyOpsPoet on Twitter, for reasons which will become clear as time goes on. 

I'm a software guy with 20-something years in the industry, and I've played a lot of different roles from Web Developer to Head of Infrastructure and quite a lot of everything else in between. 

I do talks and presentations occasionally, and I have always had a bit of a thing for sharing knowledge and trying to spread ideas around, whether they're good or bad, so this is what the channel will be about. I've worked at a lot of different companies and seem a lot of approaches to software delivery. I have OPINIONS. They may be right, they may be wrong, but they are opinions and I WILL share them.

Sometimes I'll upload a straight version of a talk I've delivered. Other times I might go on an extended rant about something that I think might possibly be important. Other times I'll share something cool I've been doing lately. Maybe I'll even fire up Zoom and have a chat with some other crusty old industry veterans and see what they've got to share. 

I might even record a video when there's NOT a 3D printer running in the same room

Anyway, glad to have you here. If you like this idea, hit the old subscribe button and we'll catch up with the first video, which shuld be the Terraform Antipatterns talk I delievered recently at Melbourne Infracoders. 

Until then, may all your typos be harmless, and may all your deploys flow like fine wine.
